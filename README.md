# My project is angular based.

1. extract the developers-hire-system.rar archive

2. the folder that you get is the project's folder

To run it you have to: 
1. setup NodeJs on your machine
2. run the command npm install -g @angular/cli
3. navigate to the project's folder via cmd 
4. run the command npm install to download all the dependecies.
5. run the command ng serve -o
